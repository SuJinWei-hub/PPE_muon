This is the code of one of the physics professional experiments in SYSU, which measure the lifetime and flux of muon, called MuonExp.
### How to use the code ###
When start running, you can select different computing functions based on the number you are prompted to enter.
1) Select computering LIFETIME(1) or FLUX(2);
2) If 1 : Choose center fitting method or barycenter fitting method;
3) If 2 : Choose variable {Exit(0); HV(1); Threshold(2); Direction(3).

More specific situations can be encountered when you use it.
